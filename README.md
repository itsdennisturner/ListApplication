# ListApplication
I am able to produce the Form to accept the user's number input, but am unable to get the list to populate.
This is where I am stuck. 
I am having trouble with knowing where the logic would go for the loop to iterate the object from the model.
For example, in putting a standard for loop in the View page I get the list to print but not when it involves passing the object to the view through the controller.
I would use something like @for(int i = 0; i <= *Name of Model Object*; i++) then print the list by printing @*Name of Model Object[i] with a new line <br />
